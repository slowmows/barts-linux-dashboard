barts-linux-dashboard
=====================
The goal of this project is to create a dashboard to add users, groups, make sudoers entries, etc. across multiple machines.  It should be so easy that anyone can do it so I can focus on other things. The python code listed here is the my first try at anything python. My environment is as follows:

1) OS = CentOS release 6.5 (Final)
2) python = Python 3.4.1
3) bash = GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
